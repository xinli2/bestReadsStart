Like most of my experience of things badged 'Mensa', this book seems designed to make Mensa members and wannabe Mensa members feel good about themselves, but in reality these puzzles aren't hard enough to live up to the Mensa superintelligent image. That said, the puzzles are excellent, never running out of logic. Just don't be fooled by the title.
