I first read this Jack London book fifty-five years ago. It inspired me to read more books and especially all of the London books. I enjoyed the raw animus, the Alaska wilderness, and the struggle to survive. I love adventure, the outdoors, dogs, and hiking. Consequently, this book was a perfect start for me.
