I read "Alice" as a kid and had a great memory of it but had never picked it up as an adult and more importantly I had read it in French, not speaking English as a child. I was delighted to discover how he plays with words, with the meanings, the differences and the similarities of words and expressions. In my memory this book was all about imagination, now I can see that it's also about how you can play with words, how language can be a wonderful thing.
